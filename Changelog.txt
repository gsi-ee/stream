21.11.2012  
Start of project, first line of code

23.11.2012 
First checkin in repository

26.11.2012
Group all new classes in one directory and one library 

27.11.2012 
Change to the two-scan algorithm. Exactly two full scan of data are required.
This simplifies logic how all kind of intermediate data can be processed.  
As consequence, many events can be produced by scan of next buffer.
Each processor fills its own subevent, which are than collected together in 
common event.
Provide Event and SubEvent classes. Implement event building.
Code shows reasonable results with ROC data from CERN beamtime.

27.11.2012 
Remove user source class from go4wrapper. 
Now event production works inside normal processor of the first 
step and one can normally configure it with all available go4 sources.
Many input events can be queued internally, many output events can
be produced via SetKeepInputEvent() logic. 
Thus N->M problematic is fully implemented! 

27.11.2012
Introduce simple typedefs for GlobalStamp_t and LocalStamp_t
Provide local/global time for each buffer, liner interpolation of
time between two sync markers, helper index to locate faster region 
between two syncs.

27.11.2012
First test with cern-gem12 data, where aux2 on ROC4 was used as trigger.
One need to implement special kind of "flush" trigger when no reference signals 
for long time to avoid over-fill of all queues. Anyhow, first reasonable results! 

28.11.2012
Master time now can be assigned, by default processor with trigger source is used. 
Flush trigger is implemented, it allows to avoid situation when many data without 
trigger must be accumulated in the queues. Flush trigger generated about once 
per buffer in master processor. cern-gem12 starts to look very reasonable. As next
step, normal region-of-interest selection should be implemented, no-trigger-mode and
configurable message sorting.    

29.11.2012 
Define trigger marker as time interval - first step direction Region-of-Interest
concept. Later one could not only select events, but rather intervals which are
than delivered to next steps. As next iteration, forwarding of complete data stream
with regular time intervals (like 1 ms) should be implemented. 
Message time sorting is implemented.  

30.11.2012
Attempt to implement last-epoch bit correction, many other side-effects are discovered
with nXYTER/Optic readout, especially for CERN/SPS 2012 beamtime. Many open questions
are remained. Allow to specify initialization script name - like setup_get4.C or 
setup_cern_oct12.C. Calling arguments are:
go4analysis -file file.lmd -args setup_get4.C
Primary classes for GET4 analysis. 
Possibility of raw analysis only.

3.12.2012
First test with running GET4 v1.0 setup. 
Implement several basic histograms for GET4.

7.12.2012
Add reference channel for simple reference calculations
in GET4 processor.
Add second level for histogram prefixes like ROC0/GET4_2/Ch2

10.12.2012
One another method for last-epoch correction.
While main problem is CERN/SPS beamtime, make heuristic for exactly
this data. Seems to be, MSB bits gives us the best possibility for selection.
With some other checks 99.5% of corrupted data can be repaired. 
Rest are other errors (next-epoch problem or wrong bits is time stamp) 
do not have any chance to be correctly fixed. My estimation gives 
about 0.1% of such nasty messages.  

11.12.2012
First step to non-synchronized data streams. Any number of SYNCs can be
produced now, simple algorithm looks for the same SYNC id to set global
times and introduce time calibrations. Works with run87 of CERN/SPS beamtime.
Fix problem with time uncertainty parameter for NX processing.
Implement two-dimensional histograms. Add such in NX processing.
One need to make histogram filling optional - can take significant amount of time. 
Without filling current NX code works 2x times faster

12.12.2012
1) Reorganize libraries and code in newmonitor - introduce second step in analysis chain. 
   At the moment this step will be go4-based code, one could make later same logic as with 
   first step. Major difference to first step that in second step events are already defined
   and one do not require any complex queueing of input data.
   Second step also should be reinitialized via separate macro - named second.C.
   There all sub-processors should be instantiated.  
2) Introduce skeleton for get4test code, based on two-step approach.      
3) Introduce SysCoreProc class, which should be base for all kind of ROC-based analysis.
   Aim not to introduce common message loop (as in very first go4monitor) but
   rather common structures and histograms.
4) Add possibility to skip time synchronization for some streams. It is
   useful when the only stream is used or when streams synchronized anyway,
   like in optic case.
5) Add possibility to define regions-of-interests in get4 based on some ref channel. 
   For a now primitive (only single channel), later one could apply trigger-like 
   logic to several Get4 channels (like in GSI beamtime nov-2012). 
   Very preliminary, seems to be work with latest test data.  
   
13.12.2012
1) Create message and iterator classes for nx and get4 analysis. 
   These were last connection to ROClib. Therefore from this point:     
2) Move further development from ROClib to go4/app repository.
   Main motivation - there are parts which could be interesting not only for CBM/ROC users.
3) Rename to "stream" project. Name will probably change, but main idea - 
   it is flexible stream-based analysis.
4) Reorganize folder structure. Separate framework, go4engine and application.
   Introduce project-wide build rules and Makefiles.
5) In get4test application make analysis of selected hits. 
   First produce only widths. Cleanup code of basic get4::Processor class.
   Implement printing for get4, handle it via central SysCoreProc class  
   
14.12.2012
1) Avoid local-trigger duplication or very close distance between them.
   Is a case with corrupted GET4 data. Now one can set minimal margin between
   two consequent events. Implemented for both GET4 and NX.
2) In get4test create summary histogram to see which channels have problems
3) Ensure that cern-gem12 analysis works without SYNC usage.
   Data flushing was activated for such case. Results histograms are the same. 
4) Implement cern-gem12 code.    

17.12.2012
1) Preliminary HADAQ code - only raw data scan at the moment
2) Distribute code between TrbProcessor and TdcProcessor.  
3) TrbProcessor navigates over TRB events-subevents and CTS data,
4) TdcProcessor is special treatment of data from FPGA-TDC. 
   It is sub-sub-processor relative to central manager. It is done while
   for each TDC time synchronization should be performed separately.
5) One can only see statistic over TDC channels, next step is TdcHit and TdcEvent
   structures 
   
18.12.2012
1) Introduce TdcMessage and TdcIterator classes. These are basic classes
   for navigation via FPGA-TDC raw data.      
   
19.12.2012
1) First try of synchronization with processor/subprocessor approach. 
   Problem here that SYNC number registered by TRB3 itself, 
   while SYNC time is recorded by every TDC individually. 
   In such case TrbProcessor just split raw data between TdcProcessor's.
   If found, SYNC messages placed in begin of raw data.
2) RawScan mode introduced in StreamProc class. 
   It indicates, than only raw data scan is performed - no any output data should
   be expected from such processor. Such mode required for TrbProcessor which works
   just like splitter.  
3) If error found in the buffer (FirstBufferScan() returns false), 
   buffer will be ignored in all consequent stages.    

20.12.2012
1) Use only valid syncs for synchronization - in case of TRB some SYNCs are dropped
   while one could not extract time stamp for them.
2) Take into account that hits from TDC channels are not sorted and 
   therefore event closing should be done by mean of channel 0 time - channel 0 is 
   always with bigger time stamp.
3) Account event multiplicity direct in TestHitTime() method - anyway it is just 
   informational value.
4) Event data for FPGA TDC 
5) Define base::SubEvent::Sort() method for time sorting, implement in all subclasses    
6) Declare template classes - base::MessageExt and base::SubEventExt.
   Many common and special virtual methods defined - like message access or Sort() or Clear().   
   Event and message structures for NX, GET4 and TDC now based on such template classes
7) Introduce templated method base::StreamProc::AddMessage, which uses 
   event/message class as parameter to add hit to specific subevent
8) Simple mbs::Processor and empty mbs::SubEvent classes. 
   For the moment specialized for cern-oct12 beamtime, later one could
   think about more generic way to integrate MBS data in such framework
9) Introduce base::LocalStampConverter which should help to convert local stamps
   to double value, taking into account all possible wraps. Class should be
   used in all places where so-called local time is produced. Such local time
   will not wrap any longer and more smart calibration could be used for the 
   local/global time calculations. 

21.12.2012
1) Shift all time stamp classes into base/TimeStamp.h file
2) Change NX and GET4 timing concept in messages/iterators/processors
   Now everywhere LocalStampConverter is used to convert timestamps 
   to local time in seconds. Change to seconds have consequence in
   most places - time conditions, safety margins and some other constants
   have been changed.
3) Really separate functionality of nx::Message/Iterator and 
   get4::Message/Iterator classes.  
4) Change hadaq::TdcIterator and hadaq::TdcProcessor to use 
   LocalStampConverter class and seconds as time units.
5) In mbs::Processor use LocalStampConverter just to emulate time scale.
   Every sync is just new second and LocalStampConverter prevents wrap 
   of such artificial time scale
            
17.01.2013
1) In GET4 analysis treat correctly rising and falling edges.
2) Make correct calculations of signal width in get4test
3) Add leading edge difference to next channel in get4test
4) Add possibility to ignore 250MHz times in get4 processor
   to avoid problems with unsynchronized clocks 
   
8.02.2013
1) Support of raw data format for Get4 and nXYTER. Simple modification, while
   complete analysis does not depends on position of SYNC messages in the buffers
2) Introducing OpticSplitter, which is required to split data after raw
   optic readout. In this case ABB put messages from all ROCs in one data stream.
    
12.02.2013
1) Add possibility to switch on/off histogram filling
2) Copy and modify Queue and RecordsQueue classes from DABC.
   They allow to allocate and use fixed-space queue for complex
   data types.
3) Replacement of std::vectors by Queue class gave significant 
   improvement in get4test, where long markers queue (~2000 items) are used.
   Each vector::erase() operation is too expensive, where Queue::pop() 
   does mostly nothing.
4) As last change, RecordsQueue used for buffers queue. 
   Probably not important for performance, but unified all queues.  

13.03.2013
1. Add new application for FPGA TDC testing on TRB3. 
   First provide possibility for raw printout of the data.
2. Fill different per-channel raw histograms for FPGA TDC (of course, optionally)
3. Implement manual calibration mode for FPGA TDC. Manual means one could generate calibration
   once (in form of binary file) and than reuse it for analysis of other data
4. Allow to disable some TDC channels, also allow to disable calibration of some channels
 
14.03.2013
1. Provide automatic calibration mode for FPGA TDC, allow to process only rising or only
   falling edges. Optimize internal data structures and performance.
   
18.03.2013
1. Implement nxyter ADC baseline compensation, using old text files. Can be used for beamtime
   analysis. Implementing of baseline measurement should be done.
2. Fix several problems in cern-oct12 analysis, where NXYTER and FPGA TDC should be
   correctly synchronized.    
   
19.03.2013
1. Analyze fine counter of TDC hit message if it was missed hit or counter out of allowed 
   range. Let configure subevents ID for CTS and TDC.
   
12.04.2013
1. Provide user source for hld files. Later one could extend it to any other user sources,
   mainly for different files formats. 
2. Strange results with UDP generators - show wrong alignment of subevents. Must
   be checked with real TRB3 data.
